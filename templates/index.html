    <h2 class="mx-auto mt-3 mb-4">BLACKJACK</h2>

    <div class="my-auto">
        <p>
            This is a Blackjack game made by using Flask, Python, JavaScript, jQueries, HTML, CSS, and SASS. The game is entirely based on points rather than actual money. Players will take turns to play against the house. If the player wins, he/she will be awarded
            a point, otherwise the next player in line will take his/her turn. The scores can be tracked live on the dedicated scoreboard. By the end of the final round, the scores are counted and the player with the highest score will be declared as
            the winner.
        </p>
        <p>Before starting the game, please take a glance at the <a href="#guide">QUICK GUIDE</a> to this particular game to familiarise yourself with how the game functions.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">OPTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Players </strong>sets the numbers of players. Up to four people can play at the same time. <strong>Decks </strong>sets the number of the decks in each play. Increasing the number of decks will make it fairly difficult to count cards.
            The highest number of decks allowed is 5.
            <strong>Rounds </strong>sets the numbers of rounds per session. The lower the rounds the shorter the game and vice versa. There is no limit for number of rounds to be played.
        </p>

    <div class="my-auto">
        <p>
            Blackjack may be played with one to eight decks of 52-card decks. The cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Kings, queens, and jacks are each worth 10, and aces may be used as either 1 or 11. The object for the player is to draw cards totalling
            closer to 21, without going over, than the dealer's cards. The best total of all is a two-card 21, or a blackjack.
        </p>

        <h3> MINI CONSOLE </h3>
        <div class="qg-wrapper">

                <img src="../static/img/guide/mini_counter.png"></img>
            </div>
            <p>
                The mini console is located at the button of the game and it continually shows the value of your current hand. If the your current hand value reaches 21 exactly, it will turn green indicating that you have "BLACKJACK".
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon finishing your turn by either winning or losing, the HIT and STAND buttons will no longer be active, indicating that you have indeed finished your turn.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qg-wrapper">

            </div>
            <p>
                If you think you have a good chance of beating the house with the cards you hold (value close to 21), you can "STAND". The house will then take its turn and try to beat your current hand.<br> While hitting to get more cards, if your current
                hand value exceeds 17, the "STAND" button will turn green, letting you know that you are at risk of going "BUST" if you keep hitting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qg-wrapper">

            </div>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, upon the end of your turn the "HIT" and "STAND" buttons will be disabled. However, in order to end your turn the "NEXT PLAYER" button <strong>MUST </strong> be clicked. The appearance of this button will indicate that
                your turn is over and you should let the next player to take his/her turn.
            </p>

                The game can also be reset at any time by the player. Be warned that doing so will erased all the current data held in session.
